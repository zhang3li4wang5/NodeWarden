## Web Deploy

1. Fork this repository. If this project helps you, consider giving it a Star.
2. Open [Workers](https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/create) -> `Continue with GitHub` -> select your forked repository (`NodeWarden`) -> continue.
3. R2 is used by default. If R2 is not enabled on your account, you can use KV instead by changing the **deploy command** to `npm run deploy:kv`.
4. Deploy and open the generated URL.

| Storage | Card required | Single attachment / Send file limit | Free tier |
|---|---|---|---|
| R2 | Yes | 100 MB (soft limit, adjustable) | 10 GB |
| KV | No | 25 MiB (Cloudflare limit) | 1 GB |

> [!TIP]
> How to keep your fork updated:
> - Manual: open your fork on GitHub, click `Sync fork`, then `Update branch`
> - Automatic: go to your fork -> `Actions` -> `Sync upstream` -> `Enable workflow`; it will sync upstream automatically every day at 3 AM

## CLI Deploy

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/shuaiplus/NodeWarden.git
cd NodeWarden
npm install
npx wrangler login

# Default: R2 mode
npm run deploy

# Optional: KV mode
npm run deploy:kv

# Local development
npm run dev
npm run dev:kv
```

## Cloud Backup Notes

- Remote backup supports **WebDAV** and **E3**
- When `Include attachments` is enabled:
- the ZIP still contains only `db.json` and `manifest.json`
- actual attachment files are stored separately under `attachments/`
- later backups reuse existing attachments by stable blob name instead of re-uploading everything every time
- During remote restore:
- required attachment files are loaded from `attachments/` on demand
- missing attachments are skipped safely
- skipped attachments do not leave broken rows in the restored database

---

## Import / Export

Current supported import sources include:

- Bitwarden JSON
- Bitwarden CSV
- Bitwarden vault + attachments ZIP
- NodeWarden JSON
- Multiple browser / password-manager formats available in the web import selector

Current supported export formats include:

- Bitwarden JSON
- Bitwarden encrypted JSON
- ZIP export with attachments
- NodeWarden JSON variants
- Full manual instance export from the backup center
